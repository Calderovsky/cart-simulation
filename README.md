# Cart Simulation

### Description

In this simple but fundamental project, I traversed the DOM, with the purpose of simulating the behaviour of a shopping cart in a simple web page; the implementation can be found in [./js/app.js](./js/app.js). The project is also hosted on [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/); to test the behaviour click on [https://verdant-gumption-efd42e.netlify.app/](https://verdant-gumption-efd42e.netlify.app/).
